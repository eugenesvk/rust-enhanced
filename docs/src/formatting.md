# Formatting

The Rust Enhanced package does not currently provide any assistance with setting up automatic code formatting using [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).
The [RustFmt](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/RustFmt) package on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) provides automatic formatting support.
[Language servers](lsp.md) can also provide this ability.
