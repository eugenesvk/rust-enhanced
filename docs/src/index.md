# Introduction

Rust Enhanced is a [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) package which adds extended support for the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
This is a replacement for the built-in "Rust" package and provides several extensions:

* Enhanced syntax highlighting which handles more recent language changes and improved highlighting.
* Custom highlighting for Cargo output.
* A custom build system with complete configuration of running Cargo and supporting Rust's extended error messages.
* Automatic checking every time you save a file.
