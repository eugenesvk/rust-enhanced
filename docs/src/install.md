# Installation

The "Rust Enhanced" package should be installed with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).
See <https://packagecontrol.io/installation> for instructions on how to install Package Control.

After you have Package Control installed, follow these steps:

1. Open the command palette (`Control Shift P` or `Command Shift P`) in Sublime Text.
2. Type the command `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Type the name `Rust Enhanced` and choose it from the list.

Installing Rust Enhanced should automatically disable the built-in Rust package.

## TOML syntax highlighting

TOML syntax highlighting is provided by a separate package called [`TOML`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TOML).
It is recommended to install this for editing `Cargo.toml` and other TOML files.
Use the `Package Control: Install Package` command and choose the `TOML` package.
